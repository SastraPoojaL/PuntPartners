I have created a home.html, font_selection.json, connect.js and style.css files to connect and create a text editor that has various features according to the options specified in the json file provided.
1. Incorporated basic html syntaxes to create a view for the text editor
2. Used basic css stylings to make the website look presentable.
3. Used javascript to connect and link the content along with the buttons and other events.

A reset button disables all the changes made and sets the value to an empty string("")
The save button ensures that the content is saved and is revoked back even after refresh.
